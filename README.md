## Fork Notes (Stears)

This fork contains bug fixes not yet merged into the upstream repo ([7tg/django-admin-mcp](https://github.com/7tg/django-admin-mcp)). The Stears `news` repo depends on this fork via:

```toml
"django-admin-mcp @ git+https://github.com/foogunlana/django-admin-mcp.git@main"
```

### Fixes in this fork

1. **M2M serialization error** ([#76](https://github.com/7tg/django-admin-mcp/issues/76), [PR #77](https://github.com/7tg/django-admin-mcp/pull/77))
   - `model_to_dict()` returns M2M fields as lists of Django model instances, which Pydantic cannot serialize
   - Fix: convert M2M values to lists of PKs and FK values to PKs in `serialize_instance()`

2. **Describe handler crash on None on_delete** ([#78](https://github.com/7tg/django-admin-mcp/issues/78), [PR #79](https://github.com/7tg/django-admin-mcp/pull/79))
   - Some fields (e.g. M2M through relations) have `remote_field` but `on_delete` is `None`, causing `AttributeError`
   - Fix: use `getattr` with a `None` check before accessing `.__name__`

### Reverting to upstream

Once these PRs are merged and a new version is released on PyPI, update `pyproject.toml` back to:

```toml
"django-admin-mcp>=<new_version>"
```

## 📥 Installation

```bash
pip install django-admin-mcp
```

Add to your Django project:

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django_admin_mcp',
    # ...
]

# urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('mcp/', include('django_admin_mcp.urls')),
    # ...
]
```

Run migrations to create the token model:

```bash
python manage.py migrate django_admin_mcp
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Expose Your Models

Add the mixin to any `ModelAdmin`. Set `mcp_expose = True` to expose direct tools:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django_admin_mcp import MCPAdminMixin
from .models import Article, Author

@admin.register(Article)
class ArticleAdmin(MCPAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    mcp_expose = True  # Exposes list_article, get_article, etc.
    list_display = ['title', 'author', 'published']

@admin.register(Author)
class AuthorAdmin(MCPAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass  # Discoverable via find_models, no direct tools
```

#### 🔒 Protecting Sensitive Fields

Use `mcp_exclude_fields` to prevent sensitive data exposure:

```python
@admin.register(User)
class UserAdmin(MCPAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    mcp_expose = True
    # Never expose sensitive fields via MCP
    mcp_exclude_fields = ['password', 'security_token']
```

### 2️⃣ Create an API Token

Go to Django admin at `/admin/django_admin_mcp/mcptoken/` and create a token. Tokens can optionally be tied to users, groups, or have direct permissions assigned.

### 3️⃣ Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client settings (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` or project `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "django-admin": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4️⃣ Use with Your Agent

Once configured, the agent can use the tools directly:

```
User: What models are available in Django admin?
Agent: [calls find_models tool]

User: Show me the latest 10 articles
Agent: [calls list_article with limit=10]

User: Get article #42 and update its title to "New Title"
Agent: [calls get_article with id=42, then update_article]
```

## 🌐 HTTP Protocol Reference

For custom integrations, the MCP endpoint accepts POST requests:

```bash
# List available tools
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "tools/list"}'

# Call a tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "tools/call", "name": "list_article", "arguments": {"limit": 10}}'
```

---

## 🔐 Security

### 🏗️ Two-Level Exposure

Models with `MCPAdminMixin` are automatically discoverable via the `find_models` tool, allowing the agent to see what's available. To expose full CRUD tools directly, set `mcp_expose = True`:

```python
# Discoverable via find_models only
class AuthorAdmin(MCPAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

# Full tools exposed (list_article, get_article, etc.)
class ArticleAdmin(MCPAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    mcp_expose = True
```

### 🔑 Token Authentication

- 🎫 Tokens are created in Django admin
- 👤 Tokens can be associated with a user, groups, or have direct permissions
- 🚫 Tokens without any permissions have no access (principle of least privilege)
- ⏰ Token expiry is configurable (default: 90 days)
- 🗑️ Revoke tokens by deleting them in admin

### 🛡️ Permission Checking

All operations respect Django admin permissions:

| Operation | Required Permission |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `list_*` / `get_*` | 👁️ **view** |
| `create_*` | ➕ **add** |
| `update_*` | ✏️ **change** |
| `delete_*` | 🗑️ **delete** |

If a token lacks permission, the operation returns an error.
